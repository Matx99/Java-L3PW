I am aware that this isn't following the whole rules from this Pokedeck project but I have chosen to make 
something easier and that I can do rather than using things I don't really know.
Indeed, I for example didn't put graphic interface but I'm using console. 

Here's the class diagram: https://i.ibb.co/ysTm0YB/Capture.jpg

I implemented multiples functions (add, remove and seek for a card, display deck, edit a card and leave the application).
I also added a bonus function: a game. It works like that:
user picks two cards, the one that has the highest attack points wins the game.
